## Version 0.3.3
- Added support for utf8 identifier names
- Implemented pipe communication as an alternative to using stdio (use `"communication": "pipe"` under `"program"`)
- No longer stepping into Lua when a sourcemap exists but the line is not mapped (use stepUnmappedLines for old behavior)
- Ensuring child processes are killed on Linux
- Fixed many bugs and improved visualization of some expressions

## Version 0.3.2
- Added `ignorePatterns` option to skip over specified files when stepping (useful for busted)
- Allowed `scriptFiles` to work with leading relative paths (`./`)

## Version 0.3.1
- Removed tests from extension bundle

## Version 0.3.0
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Breakpoints for sourcemapped files now resolved at startup. `scriptFiles` option added and is required for this functionality. See [README](README.md) for more information.
- Added `LOCAL_LUA_DEBUGGER_FILEPATH` environment variable to supply the debugger script's path to environments that cannot require it normally
- Fixed issues with paths in environments that internally use absolute paths in their local project
- Fixed ignoring explicitly disabled `breakImmediately` in `start()`
- Performance improvements

## Version 0.2.3
- Added support for breaking on implicit errors in coroutines (not supported in Lua 5.1)
- Global reference to the debugger is now stored in `lldebugger`
- Fixed handling of sourcemaps with absolute paths
- Many internal upgrades, fixes, and improvements

## Version 0.2.2
- Fixed bug when tostring metamethod has errors
- Fixed handling of backslashes in args (thanks to ousttrue)
- Fixed some issues with propagation of errors
- Calls to `error` and `assert` will now break inside of coroutines

## Version 0.2.1
- Fixed handling of control characters
- Fixed issue with handling recursive metatables

## Version 0.2.0
- Experimental support for mapping variable names from source maps
- Passing executable and script through 'arg' to fully simulate standard environment
- Using function environments instead of '_G' when evaluating expressions
- Added 'scriptRoots' option for enviornments with custom loaders
- Removed 'sourceRoot' option
- Addressed output being delayed under some circumstances
- Other small bug fixes

## Version 0.1.10
- Fixed breakpoints set on first line of code
- Fixed handling of null bytes in strings
- Preventing false error break when `debug.traceback` is called by lua scripts
- Various other small bug fixes

## Version 0.1.9
- Fixed issue with tables that have custom len operator
- Fixed passing `arg` to files being debugged

## Version 0.1.8
- Suppport for debugging threads not created by coroutine.creae/wrap (fixes torch luajit)
- Fixed infinite recursion when debugger assert fails

## Version 0.1.7
- Fixed issues with finding source maps when environment supplies only filenames
- Updated some npm packages for security vulnerabilities

## Version 0.1.6
- Fixed issues with output parsing, including hangups and incorrect newlines
- Fixed issues with paths in source maps

## Version 0.1.5
Fixed path formatting on windows when custom lua interpreter uses forward slashes

## Version 0.1.4
Fixed issues with package search paths
- Default lua paths are now correctly retained when `LUA_PATH` is not set
- Correctly handling version-specific `LUA_PATH` environment variables (`LUA_PATH_5_2`, etc...)

## Version 0.1.3
Fix for attempting to debug builtin functions in luajit

## Version 0.1.2
Fix for empty source mappings

## Version 0.1.1
Fixed installation from marketplace

## Version 0.1.0
Initial release
